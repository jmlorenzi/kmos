Entry point module for the command-line
   interface. The kmos executable should be
   on the program path, import this modules
   main function and run it.

   To call kmos command as you would from the shell,
   use ::

       kmos.cli.main('...')

   Every command can be shortened as long as it is non-ambiguous, e.g. ::


    kmos ex <xml-file>

   instead of ::

    kmos export <xml-file>


   etc.
