I found a bug or have a feature request. How can I get in touch ?

My rate constant expression doesn't work. How can I debug it?
    When initializing the model, the backend uses
    `kmos.evaluate_rate_expression`. So you can try ::

        from kmos import evaluate_rate_expression
        evaluate_rate_expression('<your-string-here'>, parameters={})

    where parameters is a dictionary defining the variable that
    are defined in the context of the expression evaluation, like so ::

        parameters = {'T': {'value': 500},
                      'p_NClgas': {'value': 1},
                      }

    Test only parts of your expression to localize the error. Typical
    mistakes are syntax errors (e.g. unclosed parentheses) and
    forgotten conversion factors (e.g. eV) which can easily lead to
    overflow if written in the exponent.


How can I print the chemical potential value, that kmos is using internally?
    You can then print the explicit value for specific conditions in `kmos shell`, for
    example like so ::

        from kmos import evaluate_rate_expression
        print(
            evaluate_rate_expression('mu_COgas',
                {'T':{'value':600},
                 'p_COgas': {'value':1}
                 }
                 )))

    where 'CO' should be replaced by whatever gas species you are inspecting. And the
    resulting number is given in eV.
    kmos linearly interpolates the gas phase chemical potential from the NIST JANAF
    thermochemical tables if you have downloaded them manually. If you don't have them
    installed, an error message should get raised which explains how to do so.




When I use `kmos shell` the model doesn't have the species and sites I have defined.
    Note that Fortran is case-insensitive. Therefore f2py turns
    all variable and functions names into lower case by convention.
    Try to lower-case your species or site name.

When I run kmos the GUI way and close it, it seems to hang and I need to use the window manager to kill it.
  This is a bug waiting to be fixed. To avoid it close
  the window showing the atoms object by clicking on its
  close button or Alt-F4 or whichever shortcut your WM uses.

Running a model it sometimes prints `Warning: numerical precision too low, to resolve time-steps`
  This means that the kMC step of the current process was so
  small compared to the current kMC time that for the processor
  :math:`t + \Delta t = t`. This should under normal circumstances
  only occur if you changed external conditions during a kMC run.

  Otherwise it could mean that your rate constants vary over
  12 or more orders of magnitude. If this is the case one needs
  to wonder whether non-coarse graind kMC is actually the right
  approach for the system. On the hand because the selection of
  the next process will no longer be reliable and second because
  reasonable sampling of all involved process may no longer happen.


When running a model without GUI evaluation steps seem very slow.
  If you have a `kmos.run.KMC_Model` instance and call `model.get_atoms()`
  the generation of the real-space geometry takes the longest time. If you
  only have to evaluate coverages or turn-over frequencies you are
  better off using `model.get_atoms(geometry=False)`, which returns an
  object with all numbers but without the actual geometry.

What units is kmos using ?
  By default length are measured in angstrom, energies in eV, pressure
  in bar, constants are taken from CODATA 2010. Note that the rate
  expressions though contain explicit conversion factors like `bar`,
  `eV` etc. If in doubt check the resulting rate constants by hand.

How can I change the occupation of a model at runtime?
  This is explained in detail at :ref:`manipulate_model_runtime` though
  the import bit is that you call ::

     model._adjust_database()

  after changing the occupation and before doing the next kMC step.


How can I quickly obtain k_tot ?
    That is ::
        model.base.get_accum_rate(model.proclist.nr_of_proc)

How can I check the system size ?
    You can check ::
        model.lattice.system_size
    to get the number of unit cell in the x, y, and z direction.
    The number of sites per unit cell is stored in ::
        model.lattice.spuck
    a.k.a Sites Per Unit Cell Konstant :-).
    Or you check ::
        model.base.get_volume()
    to get the total number of sites, i.e. ::
        model.base.get_volume() == model.lattice.system_size.prod()*model.lattice.spuck
        => True
