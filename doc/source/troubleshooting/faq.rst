What other kMC codes are there?
  Kinetic Monte Carlo codes that I am currently aware of,
  that are in some form released on the intertubes are
  with no claim of completeness :

  - `akmc <http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/akmc/>`_ (G. Henkelman)
  - `Carlos <http://www.win.tue.nl/~johanl/projects/Carlos/>`_ (J. Lukkien)
  - `chimp <http://www.koders.com/cpp/fid7FA324E3E76DB9874158BE3CF722405FA44AECE8.aspx?s=mdef%3Ainsert>`_ (D. Dooling)
  - `KMCLib <https://github.com/leetmaa/KMCLib>`_ (M. Leetma)
  - `mapkmc <http://www.dion.che.udel.edu/downloads.php>`_ (D. Vlachos)
  - `Monty <http://www.vsc.science.ru.nl/deij/monty.html>`_ (SXM Boerrrigter)
  - `MoCKa <http://www.itcp.kit.edu/deutschmann/288.php>`_ (L. Kunz)
  - `NASCAM <http://www.fundp.ac.be/sciences/physique/larn/NASCAM-Homepage>`_ (S. Lucas)

  - `Zacros <http://zacros.org/>`_ (M. Stamatakis)

  Though The Google might find you some more.
  Please drop me a line if you find any information
  inaccurate.

What does kmos stand for anyways?
  Good question, initially kmos was supposed to stand for
  `kinetic modeling on steroids` because it feels really fast to model with kmos. But that confused people
  too much since we are not modelling reactions on steroids but on surfaces :-).
  Some other popular variants are

    - kMC Modeling Of Surfaces
    - kMC modeling offering source
    - kMC models on screen

  I am open for suggestions.
